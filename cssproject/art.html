                    The School of Art at the University of Manitoba offers dynamic programs where
                    students gain hands-on experience across a broad range of artistic disciplines. 
                    Our focus is on preparing students for a successful career in the arts at a time 
                    when creativity, critical thinking and complex problem solving are in greatest demand.
                    An Arts degree is valuable for its ability to help you understand the world,
                    explore topics relating to languages, culture and society, and give you a 
                    wide range of new skill sets. Students usually begin in the Bachelor of Arts
                    General (3-year) program with an undeclared major and minor program of study. 
                    After declaring a program of study, you can elect to pursue a BA Advanced (4-year) 
                    degree or a BA Honours (4-year) degree after meeting the qualifying requirements.
